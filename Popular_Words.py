words= ["i","was","three","near"]

def find_word(test_string,words):
    # initiliazing an empty dictonary
    answer = {}

    # converting all characters into lower case characters
    test_string=test_string.lower()
    # split the string into a list with every word as an element
    splitted_words= test_string.strip()

    # now you iterate over the given words you want to count
    for  word in words:
        answer[word]=splitted_words.count(word)

    return answer
